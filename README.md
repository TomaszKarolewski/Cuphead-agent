# Cuphead agent

The goal of this project is to practice and master new skills in neural networks. Cuphead is a single player platform game with cartoon design. As for me this game doesn't belong to the easiest ones, so I was curious if I would be able to train network which could help me to get better score in game.

I have found two attempt in the internet, first was to fit whole screen from game to reinforcement neural network and receive keys to press.  Second try was to train object detection network and basing on position of the objects on the screen train train reinforcement neural network to navigate player. Both of this attemps were interesting, but they were using autonavigated missiles.
